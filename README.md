# Crypto-Sector-Comparison
This project analyzes and compares the performance of different crypto categories over a chosen time period. It retrieves necessary category and token data via the CoinGecko API, calculates each categoryâ€™s weighted price (normalized to 100 on the start date), and visualizes their trends through interactive comparative charts.

## CoinGecko API (Free / Demo Plan) Limitations:
- Historical data is limited to the past 365 days only.
- You can only set the time range by "days ago", not a custom startâ€“end range.
- Each category returns only the first page of tokens (max 100); here we limit to 20 for speed.
- Sector-level full token lists are not available.
- The free plan works but may be slower.
- ðŸ‘‰ For broader or more precise data, consider a [CoinGecko paid API plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing).
